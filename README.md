# rarefaction-extrapolation

R script for producing rarefaction curve and extrapolating estimated species richness using iNEXT package.

## Getting Started

These instructions will enable you to run the RichnessRarefactionExtrapolation.R script.

### Prerequisites
1. R 3.4.3+
2. RStudio 1.1.423+

### Installing

Download this repository and unzip it to a folder on a drive accessible to your computer. Local drives may perform better than network drives.

Open the script in RStudio to run.

## Usage

### Individual-based rarefaction and extrapolation of herbarium record dataset
* Data must be formatted prior to use in this script. See the example file included in the repository (VoucherCount.csv).
* Script should be run from RStudio. Future development should allow execution of script as stand-alone executable.

## Credits

### Built With
* R 3.4.2
* RStudio 1.1.423
* Notepad ++

### Authors

* **Timm Nawrocki** - *Alaska Center for Conservation Science, University of Alaska Anchorage*
